          <p>
            I am a diligent and detail-oriented software developer based in
            Pune, Maharashtra, with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Application
            from Vishwakarma College of Arts, Commerce, and Science. Throughout
            my academic and professional journey, I have developed a strong
            foundation in various web technologies, including HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and React.js, as well as proficiency in database
            management using SQL/Sequel and SAP HANA.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden-content">
            During my tenure at Accenture as a Software Engineering - Packaged
            App Development Associate, I honed my skills in troubleshooting,
            system monitoring, and performance tuning, contributing
            significantly to maintaining optimal system performance. My
            experience includes supporting SAP Solution Manager for monitoring
            and maintenance, utilizing SQL for database administration tasks,
            and collaborating with cross-functional teams to implement system
            enhancements.
            <br /><br />
            Outside of my professional endeavors, I have pursued various
            projects to further enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge. I
            have developed a range of applications, including a virtual
            assistant using Python for task automation, a Netflix clone using
            HTML and CSS for practice and learning, and web applications such as
            a calculator, currency converter, music player, and to-do list using
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have ventured into
            React.js to build applications like a news app for fetching and
            displaying news articles and a weather app for real-time weather
            information.
            <br /><br />
            I am passionate about continuous learning and growth, as evidenced
            by my pursuit of certifications in Python, SQL, and React.js, among
            others. With strong communication skills and a knack for simplifying
            complex ideas, I am eager to leverage my expertise and contribute
            effectively to the success of any team or organization I join.
